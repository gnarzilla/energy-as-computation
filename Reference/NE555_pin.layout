Pin 1: GND (Connect to Ground)
Pin 2: Trigger (Where you provide a low pulse to start the timing cycle)
Pin 3: Output (The output signal comes from here)
Pin 4: Reset (Active-low; connect to VCC if not used)
Pin 5: Control Voltage (Connect to GND via a small capacitor, e.g., 100nF for stability)
Pin 6: Threshold (Used to compare voltage to end the timing cycle)
Pin 7: Discharge (Used to discharge the timing capacitor)
Pin 8: VCC (Connect to positive voltage, e.g., +5V)
