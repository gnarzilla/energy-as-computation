# Energy-as-Computation

## Overview
**Energy-as-Computation** is an innovative hybrid analog-digital project that explores new ways of computing by leveraging energy states as part of the computation process. By integrating analog components with digital logic, the project aims to develop a more efficient, flexible, and versatile system for tasks that traditional binary systems may not handle optimally. The project combines elements of continuous signal processing, digital control, and modular system design.

## Project Goals
- **Analog-Digital Hybrid Computing:** Develop a computing system that utilizes analog energy states alongside digital operations, enabling unique approaches to processing and calculation.
- **Energy-Efficient Design:** Explore the possibility of reducing power consumption by encoding data through energy signatures and modulations, minimizing the need for traditional binary switching.
- **Modular and Adaptable:** Create a modular framework that can adapt to different configurations, allowing the system to handle diverse computing tasks ranging from simple logic operations to complex simulations.
- **Proof-of-Concept Prototyping:** Develop prototypes that demonstrate the functionality and potential of analog-digital hybrid logic, including simulations, physical builds, and potential software language integration.

## Key Features
- **Analog Logic Gates:** Design and implement gates that function based on analog energy states, such as varying voltages, frequencies, or currents, to represent data and perform computations.
- **Hybrid Programming Language:** Explore the development of a programming language that seamlessly integrates analog operations with traditional digital logic, allowing for complex, continuous calculations.
- **Low-Level and High-Level Integration:** Support for both low-level (hardware) experiments and high-level (simulations, modeling) explorations.
- **Modular Simulation Framework:** Run simulations to test various analog and digital configurations, providing insights into how energy states can be harnessed for computing.
